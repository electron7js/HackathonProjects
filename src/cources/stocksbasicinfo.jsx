          Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you purchase a stock,
          you own a share of the companyâ€™s assets and earnings. Stocks are
          typically categorized into two main types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Common Stocks:</strong> These provide voting rights and
            potential dividends based on company performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preferred Stocks:</strong> These offer fixed dividends and
            are prioritized over common stocks in case of bankruptcy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a Stock Market?</h2>
        <p className="intro">
          The stock market is a platform where buyers and sellers trade shares
          of publicly listed companies. It's divided into two main categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primary Market:</strong> Where companies issue new stocks
            through initial public offerings (IPOs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secondary Market:</strong> Where investors buy and sell
            stocks among themselves.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="intro">
          Examples of major stock markets include the New York Stock Exchange

        <h2>How Does Stock Trading Work?</h2>
        <p className="intro">
          Stock trading involves buying and selling shares to capitalize on
          price movements. Trading can be done through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Day Trading:</strong> Buying and selling stocks within the
            same day, often using short-term price strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Swing Trading:</strong> Holding stocks for a few days or
            weeks to capitalize on price trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Long-Term Investing:</strong> Holding stocks for years to
            benefit from compounding returns and dividends.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="intro">

            distributed to shareholders.
