        <h2>What is Stock Trading?</h2>
        <p className="intro">
          Stock trading involves buying and selling shares of publicly listed
          companies. The goal of trading is to capitalize on price movements,
          either short-term or long-term, depending on the trading strategy.
        </p>
        <p className="intro">
          Unlike long-term investing, stock trading focuses on timing the
          market to achieve gains. This requires understanding the stock market,
          its patterns, and associated risks.
