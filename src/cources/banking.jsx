      <h1 className="title">Understanding Banking: A Fundamental Pillar of Modern Economies</h1>
      <p className="intro">
        Banking plays a critical role in the functioning of modern economies, serving as a cornerstone for financial stability and growth. 
        It involves institutions that accept deposits, offer credit, and provide various financial services to individuals, businesses, and 
        governments. By facilitating transactions and managing risks, banks contribute significantly to economic development.
      </p>

      <h2>The Role of Banks in the Economy</h2>
      <p>
        Banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. They pool funds from depositors and channel them into productive 
        investments, such as loans for businesses and individuals. This activity fosters economic activity by enabling businesses 
        to expand, individuals to purchase homes, and governments to finance infrastructure projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Banks also ensure the safe storage of money and provide essential payment services, including issuing debit/credit cards, 
        enabling online transfers, and operating ATMs. These services improve efficiency in the financial system and promote trust in 
        monetary transactions.
