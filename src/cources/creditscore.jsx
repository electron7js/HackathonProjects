        Credit scores are a crucial component of financial health, representing
        a numerical evaluation of an individual's creditworthiness. These scores
        impact many aspects of life, including loan approvals, interest rates,
        and even job applications. Understanding how credit scores work and
        their significance is essential for financial well-being.

        <h2>What is a Credit Score?</h2>

        <p>
          A credit score is a three-digit number that represents your credit
          risk based on your financial history. Scores typically range from 300
          (poor) to 850 (excellent). The higher the score, the lower the risk
          for lenders or financial institutions.

        <h2>Factors That Affect Credit Scores</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment History:</strong> Your track record of paying bills
            on time is the most significant factor. Late or missed payments
            negatively impact your score.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit Utilization:</strong> The ratio of your credit card
            balances to your credit limits. A low utilization rate (under 30%)
            is favorable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit History Length:</strong> The age of your oldest
            account and the average age of all accounts influence your score.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit Mix:</strong> Having a variety of credit types, such
            as credit cards, mortgages, and installment loans, can boost your
            score.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>New Credit Inquiries:</strong> Frequent applications for new
            credit can lower your score temporarily.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of a Good Credit Score</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Loan Approvals:</strong> A higher credit score increases
            your chances of getting approved for loans, credit cards, and
            mortgages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower Interest Rates:</strong> Borrowers with good credit
            scores often receive lower interest rates, saving money over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Higher Credit Limits:</strong> Lenders are more likely to
            offer higher credit limits to individuals with strong credit scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Employment Opportunities:</strong> Some employers review
            credit scores as part of the hiring process to assess financial
            responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rental Applications:</strong> Landlords may check your
            credit score to determine if youâ€™re a reliable tenant.
