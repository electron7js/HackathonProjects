        Central banks are the cornerstone of any nation's financial system,
        responsible for maintaining economic stability and fostering growth. As
        the apex monetary authority, central banks manage the supply of money,
        oversee the functioning of commercial banks, and implement monetary
        policy to ensure sustainable economic development.

        <h2>Functions of a Central Bank</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Monetary Policy Implementation:</strong> Central banks
            regulate money supply and interest rates to control inflation,
            stabilize currency, and foster economic growth. Tools such as open
            market operations, reserve requirements, and interest rate
            adjustments are commonly used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Issuance of Currency:</strong> A central bank is responsible
            for issuing the national currency, which serves as legal tender.
            This ensures a stable and uniform monetary system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lender of Last Resort:</strong> In times of financial
            crises, central banks provide emergency funding to commercial banks
            and financial institutions to prevent systemic collapse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Foreign Exchange Management:</strong> Central banks manage
            foreign exchange reserves and intervene in currency markets to
            stabilize the national currency and maintain balance in
            international trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regulation of Financial Institutions:</strong> Central
            banks supervise commercial banks and other financial institutions
            to ensure they operate safely and soundly, protecting depositors'
            interests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Government Banker:</strong> Central banks act as the banker
            to the government, managing public debt, issuing government
            securities, and sometimes funding budget deficits.
          </li>

        <h2>Importance of Central Banks to the Economy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Inflation Control:</strong> By managing inflation, central
            banks protect the purchasing power of the currency and ensure
            economic stability. High inflation erodes savings, while deflation
            discourages investment and spending.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Economic Stability:</strong> Central banks smoothen
            economic cycles by intervening during recessions and booms. For
            instance, during economic slowdowns, they may lower interest rates
            to stimulate spending and investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial System Stability:</strong> By regulating and
            monitoring financial institutions, central banks ensure a resilient
            financial sector, minimizing risks of bank failures and financial
            crises.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encouraging Investment and Growth:</strong> A stable
            monetary environment fosters investor confidence, leading to more
            investments, job creation, and economic growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Economic Role:</strong> Central banks also play a
            crucial role in the global economy, particularly in managing
            exchange rates and ensuring smooth international trade.
          </li>
